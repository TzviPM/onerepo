### `one install`

Install the oneRepo CLI into your environment.

```sh
one install [options]
```

`npx something-something`? `npm run what`? `yarn that-thing`? `../../../bin/one`? Forget all of that; no more will you need to figure out how to run your CLI. Just install it directly into your user bin PATH with this command.

As an added bonus, tab-completions will be added to your .zshrc or .bash_profile (depending on your current shell).
