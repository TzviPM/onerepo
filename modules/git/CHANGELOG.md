### Patch Changes

- Fix building/exporting as faux-esm. oneRepo still requires you to register a runtime requires interpreter like `esbuild-register` until such a time as yargs and others fully support ESM across all APIs. [#79](https://github.com/paularmstrong/onerepo/pull/79) ([@paularmstrong](https://github.com/paularmstrong))

- Ensure git operations are run in dry mode [#117](https://github.com/paularmstrong/onerepo/pull/117) ([@paularmstrong](https://github.com/paularmstrong))

- When looking for modified files, merge the current status along with the diff-tree from merge-base. This mostly affects plugin-changesets when running `changsets add` in that adding multiple changesets in a single command will continue to show all affected workspaces each time, regardless of uncommitted status.
