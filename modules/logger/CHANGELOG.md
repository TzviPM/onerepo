# @onerepo/logger

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix building/exporting as faux-esm. oneRepo still requires you to register a runtime requires interpreter like `esbuild-register` until such a time as yargs and others fully support ESM across all APIs. [#79](https://github.com/paularmstrong/onerepo/pull/79) ([@paularmstrong](https://github.com/paularmstrong))

- When pausing the logger, ensure the current steps are written out and not cleared first to avoid missing context. [`65a63cf`](https://github.com/paularmstrong/onerepo/commit/65a63cf5783df271a569d1e62258e389c723b56b) ([@paularmstrong](https://github.com/paularmstrong))

- Ensure no logs are written when verbosity is `0` by fully preventing `enableWrite` during the `activate` call of each `Step` [#72](https://github.com/paularmstrong/onerepo/pull/72) ([@paularmstrong](https://github.com/paularmstrong))

- Ensure git operations are run in dry mode [#117](https://github.com/paularmstrong/onerepo/pull/117) ([@paularmstrong](https://github.com/paularmstrong))
