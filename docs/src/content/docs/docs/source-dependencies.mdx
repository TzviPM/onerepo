One core benefit of a monorepo that is often missed or not enabled via tooling is the ability to use shared Workspaces as _source-level dependencies_. When our code is co-located in a monorepo, we should never have to rebuild across Workspace boundaries in order to pick up changes in their consuming, dependent workspaces.

Some implementations of monorepos fail due to their use of TypeScript or other languages and features that need to be compiled or transpiled before use across Workspaces. Some notable projects and teams have famously removed TypeScript for this reason alone.

But with oneRepo, we don't need to worry about waiting for changes, because we enable source-level dependencies out of the box.

In order to achieve a workflow that does not need pre-compilation, we point each Workspace's `package.json` entry fields the uncompiled _source_ files. These are the unbuilt, unminified versions of your files (typically in the `src` directory).

```json title="./modules/my-module/package.json"
{
	"name": "my-module",
	"type": "module",
	"main": "./src/index.ts"
}
```

Publishable workspaces may use the `publishConfig` space of the `package.json` to define the overrides for when the package will be published. This is typically a `dist` or `src` directory:

```json title="./modules/my-module/package.json" ins={5-7}
{
	"name": "my-module",
	"type": "module",
	"main": "./src/index.ts",
	"publishConfig": {
		"main": "./dist/index.js"
	}
}
```

## Ensuring conformance

Use the built-in [`one graph verify` command](/core/graph/#one-graph-verify) with a custom [JSON schema](/core/graph/#json-validation) to ensure all shared workspaces conform to using fields correctly.

```ts title="graph-schema.ts"
import type { GraphSchemaValidators } from 'onerepo';

export default {
  'modules/*': {
    'package.json': 'package.json': (workspace: graph.Workspace, graph: graph.Graph) => ({
			type: 'object',
			properties: {
        main: {
          type: 'string',
          const: './src/index.ts',
          errorMessage: '`main` field must be set to `./src/index.ts`',
        },
				publishConfig: {
					type: 'object',
					properties: {
						main: {
							type: 'string',
							const: './dist/index.js',
							errorMessage: '`publishConfig.main` must be set to `./dist/index.js`',
						},
						typings: {
							type: 'string',
							const: './dist/src/index.d.ts',
							errorMessage: '`publishConfig.typings` must be set to `./dist/src/index.d.ts`',
						},
					},
					required: ['main', 'typings'],
				},
			},
			required: ['publishConfig'],
		})
  }
} satisfies GraphSchemaValidators;
```
